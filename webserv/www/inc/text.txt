An HTTP server is a computer (software) program (or even a software 
component included in an other program) that plays the role of a server 
in a clientâ€“server model by implementing the server part of the HTTP 
and/or HTTPS network protocol(s).

An HTTP server waits for the incoming client requests (sent by user 
agents like browsers, web crawlers, etc.) and for each request it 
answers by replying with requested information, including the sending 
of the requested web resource, or with an HTTP error message.

An HTTP server may also have bindings to manage protocol extensions to 
HTTP (i.e. WebDAV, etc.) or messages of other protocols enveloped into 
HTTP messages (i.e. SOAP, etc.) in order to allow program-to-program 
communications.[citation needed]

Implementations of an HTTP server may vary in complexity, from a 
manageable tiny component to a full featured program implementation 
of HTTP and other protocols, which maybe can run in background, 
as one or more processes, etc.

An HTTP server can be found in any kind of computer, including 
embedded systems and super computers, also because it is a required 
component to run web interfaces (web applications), etc.
