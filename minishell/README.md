# Minishell

Minishell tasks us with creating a 'simple' shell.

What is a shell?
In essence, a shell serves as the outermost layer facilitating communication between the user and the operating system. It enables users to navigate and execute tasks using human-readable language. Given its crucial role, a reliable shell is imperative for seamless interaction with the system.

As part of the project, we've implemented numerous features essential to Linux shells. These include the ability to run executables from absolute or relative paths, handling pipe redirection with multiple commands, supporting quotes and single quotes (including nested ones), and performing environment variable expansion. The shell also manages specific signals such as Ctrl-C, Ctrl-, and Ctrl-D to gracefully exit the program, mirroring the behavior of bash.

Some functions are "built-in," meaning we don't call external executables but utilize our own functions within the shell. Examples of such functions include echo, pwd, cd, env, export, unset, and exit. As a bonus, the shell supports operators like &&, ||, and the wildcard *.

What we learned
Minishell represents the first Codam project where we collaborate in a group, providing a taste of real-life professional experience. Throughout this endeavor, we gained insights into Unix systems, project planning, concurrent task delegation, descriptive documentation practices, advanced git tools, automated testing, and more.
