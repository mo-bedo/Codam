# Minishell

Minishell tasks us to create a 'simple' [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)). 

### What is a shell?
Put simply, a shell is the outermost layer of communication between the user and operating system. Allowing us to navigate and execute tasks in human-readable language. If it breaks, you cannot talk anymore so it must be pretty reliable!

As part of the project we have implemented many features that are staple to linux shells. Those include running executables from absolute or relative path, like `/usr/bin/ls` or `ls`, which are fetched from the environment [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). It handles pipe redirection with as many commands as needed. It supports usage of quotes and single quotes -- including nested ones -- and environment variable expansion. It handles specific signals like ``Ctrl-C`` ``Ctrl-\`` and ``Ctrl-D`` to quit the program, in the same way as bash.

A few of the functions are ["built-in"](https://whimsical.com/minishell-R7ozXMj4gLMiR1nmeYoxDY@VsSo8s35VFfYzEkkZTzB7Q), meaning we don't call the executable, but rather our own functions from inside the shell itself. It's the case for ``echo``, ``pwd``, ``cd``, ``env``, ``export``, ``unset`` and ``exit``. As part of the bonus, the operators ``&&``, ``||`` and the wildcard ``*`` are supported.

### What we learned
This is the first project at Codam where we need to work in a group, getting closer to a real life professional experience. We have learned much about unix, how to plan a project in advance, split tasks in a way that work can be done simultaneously in multiple sections, descriptive documentation, more specialized git tools, automated testing and much more!

## Getting started
**Follow the steps below**
```bash
# Requirements: GNU Readline Library
# To install the readline library, open the terminal window and write
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

# Clone the project and access the folder
git clone https://github.com/bedauxjc/Codam.git && cd Codam/minishell

# Compile the program with
make

# Run the program
./minishell

# Write any shell command like
echo "hello minishell"

# Quit the program
exit

# Clean output objects with
make fclean

```
