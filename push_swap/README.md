# Push_swap
This project entails sorting data on a stack with a limited set of instructions, aiming for the most efficient use of moves. To achieve this, various sorting algorithms are manipulated to select the most suitable solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

What is Push_swap?
Push_swap represents an individual project at Codam, challenging us to develop a program that sorts a stack (denoted as 'a') using an auxiliary stack ('b') with specific commands: sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, and rrr. The task is to implement an algorithm that achieves sorting with the fewest possible operations. For instance, sorting an input of 100 numbers should not exceed 700 operations for maximum efficiency, and for 500 random numbers, the maximum is 5500 operations.
