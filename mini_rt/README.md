# MiniRT
This marks the first team graphics project at Codam, following our initial venture into RayTracer utilizing miniLibX.

For this project, the task involved crafting a ray tracer from the ground up, with restrictions limited to specific functions:

- open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit
- all functions within the math library
- all functions within the MiniLibX

## Instructions 
**Only works in MacOs or Linux. Follow the steps below**

After make run the executable with a scene (from the scenes folder, or create your own) as an argument (e.g. './miniRT scenes/reflective.rt')
