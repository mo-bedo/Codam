# CPP
The C++ modules are crafted to facilitate comprehension of the language's specificities in contrast to C and object-oriented programming.

CPP refers to the C++ exercises at Codam, encompassing various exercise lists covering object-oriented fundamentals such as polymorphism and inheritance, extending to C++ templates.
C++ stands as an object-oriented programming language conceived by the prominent computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrup. It emerged as an enhancement of the C family of languages, offering cross-platform capabilities and empowering developers with increased control over memory and system resources.
