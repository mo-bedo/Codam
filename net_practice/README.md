# NetPractice
NetPractice serves as an individual project at Codam designed to immerse participants in networking concepts and configurations.

What is NetPractice?
NetPractice tasks us with configuring small-scale networks. In a network, effective communication among devices is essential, and various communication protocols and models facilitate this interaction. One prominent model is the TCP/IP model, which comprises protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol). TCP/IP aims to standardize network communications, particularly for web interactions. When configuring TCP/IP settings on a device, specifying a subnet mask is crucial. This mask enables the device to discern local network IP addresses and those that should be accessed through a gateway in the device's routing table.
