# Libft - My C Standard Library
My implementation encompasses several functions from the Standard C Library, along with additional utility functions.

What is libft?
Libft stands as an individual project at Codam, tasking us with the recreation of certain C standard library functions. This includes the addition of extra functions that can be employed later to construct a library of useful utilities for the program.
